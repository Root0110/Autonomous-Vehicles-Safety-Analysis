# Autonomous-Vehicles-Safety-Analysis
Is autonomous cars definitely safer than human-driven cars? How well the AI-driven decision and control of AVs works under a variety of conditions? And how/why they disengage? With statistical and probabilistic approaches, this project explores failures and disengagements in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) being tested on public roads in California. 

 A disengagement occurs when a failure in the AV system causes control of the vehicle to switch from software to the human driver.
 
 
The dataset is derived from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database (modified a little).
